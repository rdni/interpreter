# A small interpreter
This is just a fun project, and is nowhere near optimised.

There is variable assignment using `var`, and constant assignment using `const`. Objects exist, but no computed indexing of them yet (will add when I get around to making strings).
Right now it just has 1 built in function, and no support for user defined functions.

They created an incredible series, helping to explain the concepts on tokenizing, parsing and interpreting, go check them out.
