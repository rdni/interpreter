# A small interpreter
This is just a fun project, and is nowhere near optimised.

There is variable assignment using `var`, and constant assignment using `const`. Objects exist, with computed indexing as well. Functions can be made with `function IDENTIFIER(PARAMETER1, PARAMETER2) {}`.
Right now it has 5 built in functions, and capability to create user defined functions.
